### eigenportfolio

I wrote this package to enable myself to explore the properties of eigenportfolios more seamlessly. The main phenonen I was interested in exploring was the relationship between the first eigenportfolio and the index. That is, it is well known that the first eigenportfolio essentially models the market.

Please see the examle notebook.
